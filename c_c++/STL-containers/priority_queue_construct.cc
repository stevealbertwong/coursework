The example does not produce any output, but it constructs different priority_queue objects:
- First is empty.
- Second contains the four ints defined for myints, with 60 (the highest) at its top.
- Third has the same four ints, but because it uses greater instead of the default (which is less), it has 10 as its top element.
- Fourth and fifth are very similar to first: they are both empty, except that these use mycomparison for comparisons, which is a special stateful comparison function that behaves differently depending on a flag set on construction.
